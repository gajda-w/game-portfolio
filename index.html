      <h1>Welcome!</h1>

        Welcome to my website, which serves as my portfolio designed in the
        style of a role-playing game. On this site, you will find a selection of
        my projects and skills, as well as information about me and my
        professional experience. As a passionate gamer and web developer, I've
        combined my two interests to create this unique portfolio. The design
        and functionality are inspired by RPG games, with character selection
        screens and interactive elements that make browsing through my work more
        engaging. I hope you enjoy exploring my website and getting to know me
        better. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or want
        to work together on a project.

      <p class="text">
        Hi there! My name is Wojtek and I have been working as a frontend
        developer for two years. From the beginning of my career, I have always
        strived to make my projects unique and stand out from the rest. I enjoy
        what I do and constantly work to improve my skills to create better
        projects. Outside of work, I am a big fan of RPG games and love spending
        time playing different titles. In my personal life, I am a calm person
        dedicated to my passion for Brazilian jiu-jitsu. It's not just a way to
        spend my free time, but also a way to maintain balance and fitness. I
        have a dog named Loki whom I spend every free moment with. I love our
        walks and playtime together. Loki also accompanies me during work, so
        you can often see him during my video conferences. Thanks for taking an
        interest in me!

      <p class="text">
        The portfolio I created is not just a showcase of my approach to web
        design. It's also an interactive game inspired by old RPG games, where
        the user can explore the map and get to know my projects, skills, and
        work style. I wanted my portfolio to be unique and creative, so I used
        different solutions than those found in most portfolios. I used
        technologies such as Typescript, HTML, CSS, and ThreeJS, but to achieve
        an even better effect, I used artificial intelligence to generate
        character graphics, sounds, and avatars. This made my website more
        unique and attractive. If you're interested in my approach to web design
        and would like to learn more details, I'd be happy to talk to you about
        it.
